/*
 * By default properties of objects are atomic and strong
 * By default primative types (int, float, etc.) retain by default, and atomic has no meaning for non-object types in Objc
 * Atomic has to do with thread safety. You will probably never use atomic, since it is slower and doesn't really protect against thread safety
 * ALWAYS declare all object properties as nonatomic
 * You will almost always use strong (default) or copy for objects.
 * strong/copy properties increase the retain count by 1. This means that the object pointed to by the property will exist at least as long as the object retaining it
 * weak is used mostly when you want to avoid retain cycles, and Apple uses it on view outlets
 * Can someone explain what a retain cycle is?
 * weak doesn't increase the retain count
 * So, you only want to make a property weak if you know something else is retaining it otherwise it will disappear
 * if no object has a strong reference to an entity it will be deallocated
 *

 * Reason to make objects with mutable sub-types copy is that client code can assign a mutable type to an immutable type.
 * Later the client code could mutate the string in question and this would change the pointer which is usually not what you want.
